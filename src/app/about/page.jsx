            Welcome to Cozy Threads—where comfort meets rebellion. We’re not just another brand peddling soft hoodies and buttery leggings; we’re on a mission to disrupt the “fast fashion” nonsense with apparel that feels like a hug from a cloud and lasts longer than your latest streaming subscription.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl text-gray-600">
            We believe in cozy without compromise—high-quality, ethically-sourced, and unapologetically stylish. Our fabrics? Sustainably made. Our production? Sweatshop-free. Our vibe? A little chaotic, a lot cozy.
